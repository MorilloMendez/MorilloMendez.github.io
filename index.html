							<p>I am a researcher in the instersection between data analytics, cognitive science and UX research. I obtained my PhD at the <strong>Centre for Applied Autonomous Sensor Systems</strong>  
							<a target="_blank" href="https://www.oru.se/english/research/research-environments/ent/aass/">(AASS)</a> at Örebro University as part of the 
							<a target="_blank" href="https://www.oru.se/english/about-us/our-focus-areas/successful-ageing/newbreedEUCofund/">Newbreed-Successful ageing</a> 
							interdisciplinary doctoral program, co-funded by the European Commission through the <strong>Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</strong> 
							<a target="_blank" href="	https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/cofund">(MSCA COFUND)</a>. 
							Before that, I obtained a BSc in <strong>Cognitive Psychology</strong> from Complutense University of Madrid in 2013 and completed a 
							MSc in <strong>Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience</strong> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/"> Goldsmiths College (University of London)</a> in 2014. <p>

							<strong>UX research</strong> for the automotive industry <a target="_blank" href="https://ctag.com/en/">(Automotive Technology Centre of Galicia)</a>. 
							As a natural consequence of having been surrounded by engineers and stunning new technologies for so long, my academic interests during my PhD studies 
							orbited the interdisciplinary field of <strong>Human-Robot Interaction</strong>. My research project focused on the impact of human perception in
							the design of interactions with intelligent systems for older adults. </p>

							<p>I bring nine years of experience in <strong>Behavioral Research and Data Analytics</strong>, with a strong focus on understanding and responding to users' needs. 
							My passion lies in UX research, human cognition, and employing <strong>Mixed Research Methodologies</strong> to uncover actionable insights.	I have expertise across all
							stages of research, from study design and data collection to cleaning, visualization, and conducting advanced statistical analyses for quantitative studies. 
							My ability to communicate effectively with diverse audiences stems from a proven track record of interdisciplinary collaborations and a diverse professional
							background. I pride myself on being a proactive team player who is also capable of working independently when needed. With a deep understanding of tailoring
							research methodologies to suit specific questions, I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow in my field. Currently, I am working as a <strong>Data Analyst Consultant</strong> at

					<h2>UX Research</h2>
				</header>

				<div class="list">
				
				<p>From 2015 to 2018 I worked as a UX researcher at The Automotive Centre of Technology of Galicia (CTAG). 
					During this time I added qualitative research techniques to my toolbox and tested driving solutions 
					with hundreds of users over countless hours of on-site research. The research process usually started 
					with meetings with the design and engineering team, where proposals were discussed or refined based 
					on previous results from user tests. Then, a series of studies were designed based on the questions 
					or issues we wanted to answer or explore. The studies were piloted internally, and after that, 
					potential participants were contacted and came to CTAG's premises. Each participant filled out a 
					consent form and provided some demographic information. After the tests concluded, I transcribed 
					the data and analyzed it. Finally, a report was created with the main results and conclusions. 
					Adding to this, I presented these to the stakeholders. Here I highlight two of the projects I 
					did during my time at CTAG: </p>

									<h1>MobiLAB</h1>

									<h2>
										
									<p>The MobiLAB project aimed to develop autonomous driving solutions together with the PSA group. The project involved the design and development of new features and HMIs, 
									and my role here was to test if they were accepted, used and liked by users. Given the nature of this technology, I also tested how safe it was and how safe it was perceived to be. 
									In the latter case everything was tested using CTAG's Advanced Driving Simulator and also relied on behavioral outcomes, while in the former, user tests under controlled conditions were performed in real scenarios 
									and counted more on attitudinal data.</p>
									
									<p>In the early stages of the project, the main challenge was to understand how comfortable participants felt with the idea of a car driving "by itself" before the real prototype was available.
									While solutions were implemented in a real car, I tested design concepts in the simulator to alert drivers if manual control was required, including the use 
									of Head Up Displays to maximize attention on the road. Other use cases tested in the early stages were the ways to clearly notify the users of automatic
									lane changes and take overs automatically launched by the car. The next steps of the project involved testing in the real car. The tests were performed in CTAGs own test circuit, the Vasco Sameiro car circuit in Braga (Portugal), and
									in a closed highway in Viana do Castelo (Portugal). Here we tested similar HMI design solutions than before, eventually increasing the complexity of the scenarios (e.g. other cars around, 
									works on the road, etc.).</p>
									
									<p>For these studies, I used behavioral measures such as reaction times (e.g. time to break, time to handle the steering wheel) and eye-tracking (e.g. time to notice and alert signal in the cokpit). 
									In addition, I performed observational research and annotated everything participant commented. When necessary, I performed semi-structured interviews and watched a video of the test together 
									with participants to understand and discuss their reactions to certain use cases. Some questionnaires I used were the NASA-TLX and the System Usability Scale. To supports my reports and presentations, I relied on 
									quotes from users, word clouds, testing videos, and data visualization techniques. </p>

									<p> The MobiLAB project converged in the Autopilot project, funded by the Horizon 2020 program, and derived to the Shuttle, a driverless mobility solution currently being tested in real scenarios. </p>

									<h1>DriveStick</h1>
									<h2> 
										
									<p>The Drivestick project can be considered a "spinoff" study derived from MobiLab that dwelled into semi-autonomous driving. 
									This was a smaller research derived from the fact that some users did not feel comfortable with automatic lane changes and takeovers performed by the car.
									For this reason, the gearshift of the car was redesigned with functions to initiate lane changes and takeovers by the users. 
									</p>
									
									<p>The design team created four different prototypes of drivesticks. Although all of the prototypes performed the same functions, 
									the way to initiate them and their aesthetics varied. Interestingly, there was a common preconception in the team that one of the drivesticks
									would be the favorite. However, the study was performed with a more genereric non-directional hypothesis that simply stated that when tested,
									there would be differences in the attitudes and the way people interacted with the drivesticks. 
									</p>
									
									<p>For this study, I used behavioral measures such as number of errors (e.g. accidentally initiating a lane change, or initiating one functions instead of the other), the usability testing questionnaire,
									and left some time at the end of the study to openly discuss with participants which was their preferred concept, why, and what would they change. The study was
									conceived as an experiment or an A/B test (an A/B/C/D test in this case, to be fair). Each participant tested the four concepts, but in different orders
									to prevent learning and fatigue effects. In sum, the experimental design consisted of a within-subjects test with four conditions. </p>

									<p>Results showed that although the drivestick prefered by designers was considered the most aesthetic, it was never prefered by participants
									and led to the highest number of errors (Friedman test, p&lt;0.05). Observation and interviews were crucial to understand why this happened, making this study
									a very clear example of why mixed research is the way to go in UX research. The button to change lane rested on a the sides of the drivestick. When trying to press it, participants often inclined the lever in the direction 
									of the force they were applying to press the button, which initiated a takeover. In other words, if the car was positionaed in the left lane and
									a user pressed the button on the right to return to the right lane, the user would often turn the lever to the left as it had very low resistance,
									and would take over the car that was ahead in the right lane. This study was a very concrete example of user testing and objective data leading the way. The drivestick that was preferred
									by the designers in the beggining was beatiful and it was easy to be blinded by that, but failed in usability. </p>

						<p> Referencing BoJack Horseman, back in the 2010s I was in a very famous (not at all) experimental rock band. I was the vocalist and played guitar under the name "Domjan", a behavioral psychologist whose textbook I was studying at that time. You can tell I can really get into weird stuff when I am interested. This was more than 10 years ago (phew!), but I honestly loved what we did, except the terrible name choice, the Ape Tits. This is a song, Horse Breath, which tells the story of a small man whose breath smelled like that of a horse, but who one day rode a dog and scaped from reality:  <p>

						<p> I also had some time to experiment on my own, and Birdie Hop was my side proyect for more intimate stuff. That was too long ago as well, but I am now preparing to come back again with more music, and hopefully, more musical activity in my life in general:  <p>

						<p> As you can see, not everything in my life is work, fortunately, and videogames have always been a big part of my life too. During the COVID-19 Pandemic I discovered a new hobby: modding Gameboys.	Before all the crazy retro speculation, I found a small second-hand shop in Örebro that was selling all kinds of old Gameboys for around 20€. I decided to give it a go, and these are some of those projects: <p>
